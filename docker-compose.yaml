#
# Docker-compose file for running 6.812/6.825 labs
#
# Notes: 
#    The READMEs are put in ./workspace
#    The workspace will be owned by $USER_UID:$USER_GID
#

# Run as follows:
#
#    1) Cd to the directory containing this file
#    2) Change USER_UID and USER_GID to the desired owner of your files (echo $UID in Docker Quick Start Terminal)
#    4) Run the following command:
#
#        % If you are using x86 CPU (Intel, AMD)
#        % DOCKER_ARCH=amd64 docker-compose up
#
#        % If you are using arm CPU (Apple M1/M2)
#        % DOCKER_ARCH=arm64 docker-compose up 
#
#        % If you want to avoid typing "DOCKER_ARCH=" every time,
#        % "export DOCKER_ARCH=<your architecture>" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
#
#    5) Look at output and use the 127.0.0.1 URL (unless you changed the port below)
